== Get Started with OIDC SSO

What is OIDC

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an open security protocol for single sign-on (SSO) based on the OAuth 2.0 framework. Enable OIDC to allow users to log in to the Prisma Cloud administrative console using only their email and Prisma ID. Authentication is then completed on your Identity Provider (IdP) of choice. 

Unlike SAML based SSO authentication, OIDC uses a Service Provider to authenticate users, allowing for faster set up and login times. OIDC offer a simplified, flexible method to authenticate human and machine identities and offers authentication support for applications and APIs.

As a best practice, enable a couple of administrative users with both local authentication credentials on Prisma Cloud and SSO access so that they can log in to the administrative console and modify the SSO configuration when needed, without risk of account lockout. Ensure that administrators have activated their Palo Alto Networks Customer Support Portal (CSP) account using the Welcome to Palo Alto Networks Support email and set a password to access the portal.

Administrative users accessing the Prisma cloud API cannot use OIDC and must authenticate using the the email address and password registered with Prisma Cloud.

High level overview of steps 

To enable SSO, you must first complete the setup on the IdP. Then, log in to Prisma Cloud using an account with System Admin privileges to configure SSO and redirect login requests to the IdP’s login page, so that your Prisma Cloud administrative users can log in using SSO. After you enable SSO, you must access Prisma Cloud from the IdP’s portal. Prisma Cloud supports IdP initiated SSO, and it’s SAML endpoint supports the POST method only.

+
If you want to enable JIT provisioning for users, xref:../create-prisma-cloud-roles.adoc#id6d0b3093-c30c-41c4-8757-2efbdf7970c8[Create Prisma Cloud Roles] before you continue to the next step. When you configure SSO on the IdP, you must attach this role to the user‘s profile so that the user has the appropriate permissions and can monitor the assigned cloud accounts on Prisma Cloud.

. Copy the Audience URI, for Prisma Cloud, which users need to access from the IdP.
+
.. Log in to Prisma Cloud and select menu:Settings[Access Control > SSO].

.. Copy the *Audience URI (SP Entity ID)* value. This is a read-only field in the format: \https://app.prismacloud.io?customer=<string> to uniquely identify your instance of Prisma Cloud. You require this value when you configure SAML on your IdP.

. Set up the Identity Provider (Okta, Microsoft AD FS, Azure AD, Google, or OneLogin) for SSO as described in the next section.
