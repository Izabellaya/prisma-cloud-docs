|DESCRIPTION

|*Integrated View of Run and Build details for Alerts*

tt:[Application Security]

tt:[23.7.2]

//RLP-103734 - Moved from LGA to GA in 23.7.2
|To help you as a Cloud Security Engineer investigate issues from code to cloud, the alert details now include information to trace and attribute which build-time resource has caused a policy violation for a runtime resource deployed in your cloud account. The alert details overview includes the IaC resource details and information on the build time resource. The new Traceability information helps you connect an alert from the production environment back to the origin templates in your upstream development environment.

To view the build-time details in an alert:

* You must enable a Configuration policy with the subtype Run, Build and attach it to an alert rule on Prisma Cloud.

* Your IaC templates must be onboarded through a VCS integration.

* Terraform resources must include the *yor_trace* tag so that your IaC resources are tagged with a unique UUID for tracing the relationship between the code resource and the runtime resource that is deployed from it. This is not necessary for CloudFormation.

|*Prisma Cloud Data Security - Asset Level Scan*

tt:[Data Security]

tt:[23.7.2]

//RLP-98058
|There is usually several TB or PB of data stored in your organization's S3 buckets. In order to reduce the cost associated with the scanning of a large volume of data and to provide you with more value, Prisma Cloud Data Security now provides you the option of *Asset Level Scan*. When you select this option (default) while configuring a scan, Prisma Cloud randomly scans 10% of objects or maximum of 1TB (whichever is lower) and sends the data for analysis. It stops the scan as soon as it detects an object with sensitive data and triggers a 'Storage Asset with sensitive data found' policy.

Asset Level Scan only applies when you select the Backward Scan mode and does exposure analysis and data classification and not malware scanning. It is only available when you're configuring a data security scan for your AWS cloud accounts.

image::asset-level-scan-1.png[scale=30]


|*Support for New Regions on AWS*

tt:[Cloud Security]

tt:[23.7.1]

//RLP-106201

|Prisma Cloud now ingests data for resources deployed in the Zurich and Melbourne regions on AWS.

To review a list of supported regions, select "Inventory > Assets", and choose https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/cloud-service-provider-regions-on-prisma-cloud#id091e5e1f-e6d4-42a8-b2ff-85840eb23396_id9c4f8473-140d-4e4a-94a1-523e00ebfbe4[Cloud Region] from the filter drop-down.

|*Support for Singapore*

tt:[Data Security]

tt:[23.7.1]

//RLP-104171
|Prisma Cloud Data Security is now available on the *app.sg* stack for all Prisma Cloud customers in Singapore. The data scans and data will remain within Singapore.


|*Least Privilege Access Enforcement*

tt:[IAM Security]

tt:[23.7.1]

//RLP-105018

|Streamline access management and promote secure and efficient permissions configuration with the https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-iam-security/cloud-identity-inventory[least privilege access] suggestions. Solve for over-privileged access issues that arise when you manage Identity Access through Groups or/and Roles rather than individual identities. You can now remediate over-permissive permissions effectively at the Group/Role level by creating new policies containing only the permissions applicable to all members. Alternatively, you can leverage existing policies by retaining only the permissions applicable to the entire Group/Role and removing any excessive permissions.

|*Package URL (pURL) Format Support for Vulnerabilities*

tt:[Runtime Security]

tt:[30.03.122]

//CWP-47358
|Prisma Cloud now adds package URLs (pURL) for packages and vulnerabilities while scanning the images using twistcli. This helps to reliably reference the same software package using a simple and expressive syntax and conventions based on familiar URLs.

As you scan images with `twistcli`, you can filter the CVEs based on the pURL format in the CVE viewer.

|*Registry Scan Scale Support Increased to 100k Images*

tt:[Runtime Security]

tt:[30.03.122]

//CWP-44490

|Registry image scan limit has been increased to 1,000,000 from 100,000 for all image types.

|*Support for GitLab Container Registry*

tt:[Runtime Security]

tt:[30.03.122]

//CWP-29369
|Added support for scanning GitLab Container Registry without using admin credentials to manage and get a full list of all container registries/images.

|*Malware Support through Wildfire Integration*

tt:[Runtime Security]

tt:[30.03.122]
//CWP-41082
|Added enhanced malware agentless scanning through an integration with Palo Alto Networks Advanced WildFire, the industry's leading malware scanning feed.
Malware scanning is supported across all Cloud Service Providers for Linux and Windows hosts and Linux container images, covering files suspected as Malware or Grayware.
Malware scanning supports ELF binaries in Linux and supports binaries and shared libraries in Windows, providing comprehensive protection.

|*Scan Errors Visibility Improvements in Agentless Scanning*

tt:[Runtime Security]

tt:[30.03.122]

//CWP-44086

|To get the most out of agentless scanning, this update categorizes issues during the agentless scan process, provides detailed information on their nature, source, and troubleshooting steps, and offers a seamless user interface experience. Easily understand and resolve issues, improving scan coverage and streamlining your scanning process.

As a side effect, this update might display erroneous scan details, that would be auto-remediated by a maximum of 2 agentless scan cycles.

|*Added Support for Parallel Agentless Scans of Accounts/Regions*

tt:[Runtime Security]

tt:[30.03.122]

|Added the ability for https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-compute/agentless-scanning#scanning-process[agentless scanning] to scan accounts and regions within those accounts in parallel.

The changes include the following enhancements.

* The UI shows the status of an ongoing scan for specific accounts. For example scanning or completed.

* You can see the general progress of an ongoing scan on the Compute Cloud Accounts page instead of in the progress bar.

* Your hub account is treated as an account dedicated for agentless scanning, which is used only to scan other accounts, and no longer scans itself.

* You can manage the agentless scanning configuration centrally for all target accounts in the hub account configuration. You aren't required to duplicate the configuration across all target accounts. For example, you can set custom networking configuration only on the hub account.

|*Enhanced the Syslog to include the same fields as the API*

tt:[Runtime Security]

tt:[30.03.122]

|Added fields to enhance the syslog output in alignment with the API call responses. Fields were added for container runtime audits, host runtime audits, container incidents, and host incidents.

|NEW POLICIES
|DESCRIPTION

|*Azure SQL on Virtual Machine (Linux) with basic authentication*
//RLP-104615
| Identifies Azure Virtual Machines that are hosted with SQL on them and have basic authentication.

Azure Virtual Machines with basic authentication could allow attackers to brute force and gain access to SQL database hosted on it, which might lead to sensitive information leakage. It is recommended to use SSH keys for authentication to avoid brute force attacks on SQL database hosted virtual machines.

----

*Policy Typeâ€”* Config

*Severityâ€”* Low 

|*AWS Route53 Hosted Zone having dangling DNS record with subdomain takeover risk*
//RLP-94198
|Identifies AWS Route53 Hosted Zones which have dangling DNS records with subdomain takeover risk. A Route53 Hosted Zone having a CNAME entry pointing to a non-existing S3 bucket will have a risk of these dangling domain entries being taken over by an attacker by creating a similar S3 bucket in any AWS account which the attacker owns / controls. Attackers can use this domain to do phishing attacks, spread malware and other illegal activities. As a best practice, it is recommended to delete dangling DNS records entry from your AWS Route 53 hosted zones.

|*AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) is not using the latest predefined security policy*

tt:[23.7.1]

//RLP-102409

|*Changesâ€”* The policy description and recommendation steps have been updated. The policy RQL has been updated to check for the latest security policy userinput:[ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06] 

*Updated Descriptionâ€”* Identifies Application Load Balancers (ALBs) are not using the latest predefined security policy. A security policy is a combination of protocols and ciphers. The protocol establishes a secure connection between a client and a server and ensures that all data passed between the client and your load balancer is private. A cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message. So it is recommended to use the latest predefined security policy which uses only secured protocol and ciphers.

We recommend using ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06 policy to meet compliance and security standards that require disabling certain TLS protocol versions or to support legacy clients that require deprecated ciphers.

*Severityâ€”* Low
