|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*IAM Security metrics included in Cloud Security Report powered by Adoption Advisor* 

tt:[CIEM - IAM Security Enhancement]

tt:[23.6.2] 

|Implement least-privileged access by quantifying and sharing key IAM security metrics, such as unused over-privileged permissions, now available in the Prisma Cloud Cloud Security report powered by Adoption Advisor. These newly surfaced KPIs allow you to minimize the attack surface by restricting excessive permissions that may pose a significant security risk. 

Navigate to *Adoption Advisor > Create Report* from the Prisma Cloud administrative console to explore the latest available IAM security metrics. 



|*Trendline for Critical Severity in Adoption Advisor Widgets*

tt:[CSPM]

tt:[23.6.1] 

//RLP-89871

|The Assets With Urgent Alerts, Incident Burndown, and Risk Burndown widgets have a trendline for critical severity alerts and assets to help you quickly review the trends for the most critical issues.

For Assets With Urgent Alerts, you can see the critical and high severity asset data points in all the 30, 60, and 90 day time series starting June 2023.

|*Projects Enhancements*

tt:[CAS]

tt:[23.6.1] 

|With this release on https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin-code-security/scan-monitor/monitor-fix-issues-in-scan[*Projects*] (Code Security > Projects)  here are additional enhancements helping you prioritize code issues.

* *Grouping Issues*: You can now group the scan results by *Resource* or *Policy* across code category views enabling you to prioritize code issues.

image::codesec-rn-6.1-1.png[scale=40]

* *Sort*: In addition to sorting the issues by *Severity* you can now sort by highest issue *Count*. You can sort issues across code category views and grouping.

image::codesec-rn-6.1-2.png[scale=40]

* *Filter for Enforcement*: Only for category views of *VCS Pull Requests* and  *CI/CD Runs* you now can add an *Enforcement Level* filter.  Using the filter gives you a quick insight to *Soft* and *Hard Fail* across the Enforcement parameters.

|POLICY UPDATES
|DESCRIPTION

2+|*Policy Updates—RQL*

|*AWS S3 bucket policy overly permissive to any principal*

tt:[23.6.1]

//RLP-99453

|*Changes—* The policy description and RQL are updated. The RQL now considers *Block public access* settings configuration at account and bucket Level.

*Updated Description—*
Identifies the S3 buckets that have a bucket policy overly permissive to any principal and don't have Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies enabled. It is recommended to follow the principle of least privileges ensuring that the only restricted entities have permission on S3 operations instead of any anonymous.

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium. 

*Current RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name='aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and Action anyStartWith s3: and (Principal.AWS contains * or Principal equals *) and Condition does not exist)] exists
----

*Updated RQL—*

----
config from cloud.resource where cloud.type = 'aws' AND api.name='aws-s3api-get-bucket-acl' AND json.rule = ( ( publicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist ) or ( publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false ) or ( publicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration.restrictPublicBuckets is false ) or ( publicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist and accountLevelPublicAccessBlockConfiguration does not exist ) )AND policy.Statement[?any(Effect equals Allow and Action anyStartWith s3: and (Principal.AWS contains * or Principal equals *) and (Condition does not exist or Condition[*] is empty) )] exists
----

*Impact—* Medium. Based on the Block Public Access settings at account and bucket Level, some alerts might get resolved.

2+|*Policy Updates-Metadata*

|*AWS S3 bucket policy overly permissive to any principal*

tt:[23.6.2]

//RLP-99453

|*Changes—* Updating Policy Name, and Description  

*Policy Type—* Config

*Severity—* Medium 

*Policy Name—* AWS S3 buckets are accessible to public

*Updated Policy Name—* AWS S3 buckets are accessible to public via ACL

*Description-* The policy name, description, and recommendation steps are updated to be specific on the criteria through which the S3 bucket is made public. Amazon S3 often stores highly sensitive enterprise data, allowing public access to S3 buckets through ACL results in sensitive data being compromised. It is highly recommended to disable ACL configuration for all S3 buckets and use resource based policies to allow access to S3 buckets.

*Impact—* No impact, as this is a metadata change.

tt:[23.6.1]

//RLP-102253

|The Center for Internet Security (CIS) releases benchmarks for best practice security recommendations. CIS Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) v1.4.0 - (Level 1 and Level 2) is a set of recommendations for configuring Kubernetes to support a strong security posture. Benchmarks are tied to specific Kubernetes releases. The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is written for open-source Kubernetes distribution and is intended to be universally applicable. Based on the existing CIS Benchmark, this standard adds additional Google Cloud-specific controls.

You can review this compliance standard and its associated policies on Prisma Cloud’s *Compliance > Standard* page.

|FEATURE
|DESCRIPTION

|*Rate Limit on POST /login Endpoint*  
//RLP-102319, RLP-102500

tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 23.5.1 release.] 


|The https://pan.dev/prisma-cloud/api/cspm/app-login/[POST /login] endpoint will enforce rate limiting (HTTP Response Code 429).



|*S3 Flow Logs with Hourly Partition*

tt:[CSPM]

tt:[This change was first announced in the look ahead that was published with the 23.1.1 release.]
//RLP-76433

|If you currently ingest AWS flow logs using S3 with the 24-hour partition, you need to change it to the hourly partition.

To make this change, https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/connect-your-cloud-platform-to-prisma-cloud/onboard-aws/configure-flow-logs[Configure Flow Logs] to use the hourly partition and enable the required additional fields.

*Impact*— VPC Flow logs with partitions set to *Every 24 hours (default)* will be disabled. As a result, you will no longer be able to monitor or receive alerts for these logs.
